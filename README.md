# built-up-area-detection-using-deep-learning

Hi all, I am Toby. I just did a few buil-up-area detection using deep learning. I created maskfile aka label data by reclassifying google earth engine derived data into 1 and 0.

P.s You can reclassify any of the landcover type by assigning desire data into 1 and the rest to zero thus creating a desired mask file. 

Please download training data from the below google drive links :
